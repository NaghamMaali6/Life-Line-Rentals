# Life-Line-Rentals
The scope of the Lifeline Rentals project is to create a complete database-driven application for the Palestine Medical Complex to manage the rental of medical equipment. This system will track customers, equipment rentals, payments, and maintenance requests. The platform will also manage the hospital’s relationships with equipment suppliers. The aim is to simplify the equipment rental process for the hospital’s staff and ensure efficient management of rental transactions. The system will handle everything from customer registration to rental tracking, equipment availability, and payment processing, ensuring necessary medical equipment is always available for those in need.

The Medical Equipment Rental Service system will be developed as a Java application for the Palestine Medical Complex hospital, utilizing a standard personal computer (PC) running a Windows operating system. The project will leverage MySQL as the relational database management system, ensuring efficient management of SQL tables for entities such as customers, equipment, and rentals. Java's robust features will facilitate seamless database interactions through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), while the front-end will be designed using JavaFX in combination with Scene Builder. This allows for a user-friendly interface with a drag-and-drop design approach, enhancing development speed and maintainability.
The development process will begin with setting up the MySQL database to create necessary tables, followed by building a JavaFX project within Eclipse IDE. Scene Builder will generate an FXML file that defines the user interface layout, with a corresponding Java controller class managing user interactions. This setup ensures a clear separation of concerns, where the backend handles business logic and database queries, while the frontend manages user interface elements. By implementing this technology stack, the system will provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for managing medical equipment rentals, ultimately improving operational effectiveness at the hospital.
